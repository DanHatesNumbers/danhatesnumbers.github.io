Hi, I'm Dan! I'm an Application Security Engineer from the UK, where I mostly spend my time working on the [Kiln project]({% post_url 2020-02-19-Building-a-data-driven-AppSec-programme-with-Kiln %}) and helping engineers write more secure software. Prior to working in InfoSec, I was a Quality Engineer and Software Engineer. In my spare time I enjoy Baking, D&D and Locksport.
